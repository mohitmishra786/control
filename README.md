# Control

Linux-like power for macOS - One binary to rule your Mac.

Control is a single, efficient, open-source binary that consolidates fragmented macOS interaction and workflow management tools. It addresses critical pain points in macOS that frustrate power users and drive them toward Linux alternatives.

## Goals

- Safety First: Never compromise system stability or user data.
- Zero Trust: Validate everything, assume nothing.
- Linux Parity: Provide power-user controls that Linux offers natively.
- Performance: Native speed, minimal resource usage.

## Features

- Window Management: Fixing corner grab detection, tiling engine, and traffic light normalization.
- Input Control: Mouse acceleration curves, per-device scroll direction, and gesture mapping.
- Permission Management: SIP-compliant permission automation and quarantine handling.
- UI Consistency: Standardizing visual inconsistencies across macOS applications.

## Requirements

- macOS 12.0+ (Monterey and later)
- Swift 6.0+

## Installation

Work in progress.
